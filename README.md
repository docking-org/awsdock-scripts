# awsdock-scripts

There are two main modules in this repository:

1. aws-setup

This module contains scripts to automate the setting up of an AWS Batch environment for distributed computing, and is not specific to docking.
Thus, this is the most valuable module for those looking to set up their own non-docking calculations in the cloud, and encodes much expert knowledge on the AWS Batch system.

2. awsdock

This module contains configuration files & scripts specific to running UCSF DOCK in the cloud.
